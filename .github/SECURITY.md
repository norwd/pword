# Security Policy

*Be sure to also read my [general security policy]*

This a relatively small project, intended to explore password generation
techniques, especially in relation to memorability while maintaining high
entropy. However, security is still a high priority. I am not qualified  to say
that passwords produced by `pword` are secure to one degree or another, but I do
believe that they are secure enough for low risk applications; throw-away reddit
accounts or a one time signup to a random web site.

## Supported Versions

As long as this project is being maintained, all versions are "supported", or at
least, I'll do my best to provide as much help as a solo developer can offer.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

This is a personal project, however, I would love it if people used this for
whatever application they want. If you find an issue or vunerability, please,
let me know. Open an issue or better yet, a pull request, I'd be thrilled to
merge it.
